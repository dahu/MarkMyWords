 1. INTRODUCTION                                       *MarkMyWords-intro*

MarkMyWords provides persistent bookmarking of arbitrary lines in files and the
Vim help system. Quickly and easily jump to bookmarked locations, even after
restarting Vim.

==============================================================================
 2. USAGE                                              *MarkMyWords-usage*

Bookmarking a line~

When inside a file or a Vim help file, place the cursor at a line you want to
come back to later (i.e. "bookmark") via: >

    :MMWMarkLine
<
or use the default mapping: >

    <leader>ml
<

Jumping to a Bookmark~

Open up Vim and execute: >

    :MMWSelect <tag>

<
where tag is the name you gave to that bookmark.

Or use the default mapping: >

    <leader>'l
<


:MMWSelect also supports tab completion (see |wildchar|). Try typing * at the
start of the tag for better expansion. |c_ctrl-d| will display a list of all
bookmarks or those matching the currently entered partial.


==============================================================================
 3. CONFIGURATION                              *MarkMyWords-configuration*

The following aspects of MarkMyWords' behavior are configurable with entries
like: >

    let g:markmywords_tagfile = $HOME/markmywords.tags
<
in your |$MYVIMRC|.

Options:~

|'markmywords_tagfile'|		Set the location of the bookmark tags file.
                                The default location is in MarkMyWords' plugin
                                directory.

Maps:~

Override the default mappings shown here by providing your own maps in
|$MYVIMRC| like so: >

        nmap <leader>ml :MMWMarkLine<CR>
        nmap <leader>'l :MMWSelect<SPACE>
<

Commands:~

:MMWMarkLine                    Mark the current line. This will prompt for a
                                bookmark name and store it in the tags file.

:MMWSelect <tagname>            Jump to a previously bookmarked line, where
                                tagname is the name of the bookmark. Tab (|wc|)
                                completion and |c_ctrl-d| expansion while typing
                                the tagname are supported.

:MMWList                        Displays the list of bookmarks.
