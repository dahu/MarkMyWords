2. Usage				|MarkMyWords-usage|
3. Configuration			|MarkMyWords-configuration|

==============================================================================
 1. INTRODUCTION                                       *MarkMyWords-intro*

MarkMyWords provides persistent bookmarking of arbitrary lines in files and the
Vim help system. Quickly and easily jump to bookmarked locations, even after
restarting Vim.

==============================================================================
 2. USAGE                                              *MarkMyWords-usage*

                                                          *MMW_MarkLine()*
Bookmarking a line~

When inside a file or a Vim help file, place the cursor at a line you want to
come back to later (i.e. "bookmark") via: >

    :MMWMarkLine
<
or use the default mapping (<plug>MMW_MarkLine): >

    <leader>ml
<

                                                            *MMW_Select()*
Jumping to a Bookmark~

Open up Vim and execute: >

    :MMWSelect <tag>
<
where tag is the name you gave to that bookmark.

Or use the default mapping (<plug>MMW_Select): >

    <leader>'l
<

:MMWSelect also supports tab completion (see |wildchar|). Try typing * at the
start of the tag for better expansion. |c_ctrl-d| will display a list of all
bookmarks or those matching the currently entered partial.

                                                            *MMW_Browse()*
Browsing Bookmarks~

Open up Vim and execute: >

    :MMWBrowse
<

Or use the default mapping (<plug>MMW_Browse): >

    <leader>mb
<

NOTE: Depends on https://github.com/dahu/VimFindsMe

This opens a |VimFindsMe| browser which uses a live |:Filter| to search for the
desired tag if you have https://github.com/dahu/Vimple installed. Pressing
<enter> on a line from within the VFM browser will trigger |MMW_Select| on the
related term.

==============================================================================
 3. CONFIGURATION                              *MarkMyWords-configuration*

The following aspects of MarkMyWords' behavior are configurable with entries

<
in your |$MYVIMRC|.

Options:~

                                The default location is in MarkMyWords' plugin

        nmap <leader>mb <plug>MMW_Browse
<
