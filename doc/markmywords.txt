==============================================================================
 1. INTRODUCTION                                             *MarkMyWords-intro*

MarkMyWords provides an easy bookmarking feature for a line in your file or
bookmarking one of Vim's help files to allow you to come back to it at a later
time, even after you close Vim.

==============================================================================
 2. USAGE                                                    *MarkMyWords-usage*

Bookmarking a line~

When inside a file or a vim help file, place the cursor at a line you want to
come back to later (i.e. "bookmark") via: >

    :MMWMarkLine
<
or using the default mapping: >

    <leader>ml
<

Jumping to a Bookmark~

Open up Vim and execute: >

    :MMWSelect <tag>

<
where tag is the name you gave to that bookmark.

Or use the default mapping: >

    <leader>'l
<


:MWSelect also supports tab completion. Try typing * at the start of the tag
for better expansion.


==============================================================================
 3. CONFIGURATION                                    *MarkMyWords-configuration*

The following aspects of MarkMyWords' behavior are configurable with entries
like: >

    let g:markmywords_tagfile = $HOME/markmywords.tags
<
in your |$MYVIMRC|.

Options:~

|'markmywords_tagfile'|		Set the location of the bookmark tags file.
                                The default location is in MarkMyWords' plugin
                                directory.

Maps:~

Override the default mappings shown here by providing your own maps in
|$MYVIMRC| like so: >

        nmap <leader>ml :MMWMarkLine<CR>
        nmap <leader>'l :MMWSelect<SPACE>
<

:MMWMarkLine                    Mark a line. This will ask for a name of the
                                bookmark and store it in the tags file.

:MMWSelect <tagname>            Jump to a previously bookmarked line, where
                                tagname is the name of the bookmark. Tab
                                completion while typing the tagname is
                                supported.

:MMWList                        Returns the list of bookmarks.
